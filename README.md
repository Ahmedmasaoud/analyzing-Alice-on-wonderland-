# analyzing-Alice-on-wonderland-

This is a sentiment analysis project on novels. In this project, I will be analyzing the emotions expressed in a novel we all love since childhood, 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.'
But why do we analyze emotions in novels? Here are some reasons why we conduct this kind of analysis:

1. Analyzing Emotional Arcs
2. Comparing Literary Styles and Authors
3.Understanding Reader Emotion
4.Enhancing Book Recommendations and Personalization
5.Guidance for Writers
